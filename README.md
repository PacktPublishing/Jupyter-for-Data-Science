# Jupyter for Data Science- Important source
This is the code repository for [Jupyter for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/jupyter-data-science?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785880070), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
If you are familiar with Jupyter notebook and want to learn how to use its capabilities to perform various data science tasks, this is the book for you! From data exploration to visualization, this book will take you through every step of the way in implementing an effective data science pipeline using Jupyter. You will also see how you can utilize Jupyter's features to share your documents and codes with your colleagues. The book also explains how Python 3, R, and Julia can be integrated with Jupyter for various data science tasks.
By the end of this book, you will comfortably leverage the power of Jupyter to perform various tasks in data science successfully.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters 1 to 10 have codes and data files.
Some of the larger CSV files are not provided in this bundle, they can be downloaded with the links provided in the chapter.
hotshot and timeit examples in chapter 10 are dummy examples and do not produce any output.

The code will look like the following:
```
plt.xlabel("Actual Price")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Price")
plt.title("Actual Price vs Predicted Price")
```

This book is focused on using Jupyter as the platform for data science. It assumes that you have a good understanding of the data science concepts and are looking to use Jupyter as your presentation platform.
